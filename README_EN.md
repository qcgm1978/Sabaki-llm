## Core Features

This project is built on the Sabaki Go interface, integrating advanced AI
features and Galaxy Go platform integration to create a comprehensive Go
assistant:

### Galaxy Go Platform Integration

- Real-time synchronization with Galaxy Go platform games
- Support for online gameplay and spectating
- Rich display of Go game data
- Real-time updates and synchronization of game information
- User-friendly interface for managing Galaxy-related features
