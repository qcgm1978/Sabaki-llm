## Core AI Agent Features

This project is built on the Sabaki Go interface, with a focus on integrating
advanced AI features to create an intelligent Go assistant:

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration

- Serves as a standardized communication bridge between LLMs and professional
  tools
- Enables seamless collaboration between large language models and the KataGo Go
  engine
- Provides a secure, efficient framework for cross-system information sharing

### LLM (Large Language Model) Capabilities

- Interact with Go AI through natural language
- Get detailed explanations of Go positions and moves
- Ask questions about strategy, tactics, and Go principles
- Request specific board region analysis using natural language
- Persistent conversation history with up/down arrow key navigation for quick
  access to previous questions

### KataGo Professional Analysis

- Combines LLM's natural language understanding with KataGo's professional Go
  analysis capabilities
- Provides precise move recommendations and win rate analysis
- Executes corresponding analysis through MCP protocol based on LLM-processed
  user requests

### Intelligent Agent Architecture

- LLMs act as the "brain" responsible for understanding questions and generating
  natural language answers
- KataGo serves as a "professional skill extension" providing precise domain
  analysis
- MCP as a communication protocol enables efficient collaboration between the
  two
- Delivers both professional and easily understandable Go analysis experience
  for users
